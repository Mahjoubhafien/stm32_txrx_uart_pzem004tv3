STM32F401RE Communication with PZEM-004T v3.0 using Custom UART Driver
This repository contains code and documentation for establishing communication between an STM32F401RE microcontroller and the PZEM-004T v3.0 energy meter using a custom UART driver. The project demonstrates how to read energy parameters such as voltage, current, power, and energy consumption using the Modbus RTU protocol over UART.
